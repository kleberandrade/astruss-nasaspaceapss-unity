The project consists in a game based on developing expeditionary skills to help our players deal with depression and anxiety due to social distancing. Using video calls, our goal is to unite friends and families in a virtual environment, playing games and dealing with isolation together.

## How We Developed This Project

Everyone in the team has seen some people struggle with the social distancing. Family members, friends, coworkers, we all know someone who really suffers due to the lack of interaction with other people. This, along for our love for getting together and playing games, gave us the idea to try and replicate the experience of playing a card, board or any kind of analog game.

The extensive use of video calls during the pandemic also made clear how this technology is very accessible to people of different ages. So we designed a clean UI in a comprehensive way so that our game can be played by families, from kids, to their grandparents.

The data given by NASA helped us get some insight on Expeditionary Skills. Our game, Astruss, is highly based on those skills. We also used the data on the effects of isolation on astronauts, as reference for better understanding what are we fighting against.

Our goal is to bring the astronauts' preparation for isolation to the players in a light and fun way.

Most of the tools we used were chosen because the team already had some experience with it. Adding the network and video call solutions were a little bit problematic at the beginning, so the development team spent the first day figuring out which tools to use and how to use them. Our teamwork was very fluid and everyone was very participative which resulted in a solid MVP.
